FriendFinder determines the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:


Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.


Example:


User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]

User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]

Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
  

Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.


The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
